## Purpose
This tool is designed to easily map positions on a pygame display without
relying on fixed pixel values.  This is done by mapping the window to a
grid, and allowing for the providing of grid co-ordinates to get the actual
pixel value on the screen.

This is designed for people getting started with pygame, or people wanting
to create uniform menu elements that scale with the display size.

## How it works
To utilise this tool, you should initialise it to a variable and pass in the
current screen size and the size of the grid you wish to use.

Once the grid has been created, you use the GridCalculator to provide
co-ordinates to the position on the screen you want to reference.  You can then
also use the ShapeFactory to place shapes on the screen based on the created
GridCalculator.

Created grids will always have a starting left and top position of 0, unless 
the optional pixel start position arguments have been provided.  Grids are
designed to be utilized against the whole pygame Surface, however it is possible
to specify a grid for a specific area of the screen or even place a grid within
a grid if needed.

## Install
To install the Grid Calculator, you can download it using PIP:

    pip install pygame-gridcalculator

## GridCalculator
### Import GridCalculator
To import the Grid Calculator use the following statement:

    from pygame_gridcalculator import GridCalculator

### Initialize GridCalculator
To initialize a grid Calculator, use the following logic to assign to a variable:

    grid = GridCalculator(display_width, display_height, grid_width, grid_height)

The arguments to specify are as follows:
* __pixel_end_left__: _The far right point of the grid in pixels_
* __pixel_end_top__: _The bottom point of the grid in pixels_
* __grid_width__: _The total number of points you want in your grid from left to right_
* __grid_height__: _The total number of points you want in your grid from top to bottom_

The following additional arguments can be provided if needed:
* __pixel_start_left__: _The far left point of the grid in pixels (defaults to 0)_
* __pixel_start_top__: _The top point of the grid in pixels (defaults to 0)_

So if you want to initialize a grid that is 8x6 for your display of 800x600, the code
would look something like:

    display = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600), pygame.RESIZABLE)
    grid = Grid(display.get_width(), display.get_height(), 8, 6)

Or if you want to initialize a grid that is 2x2 for your display of 200x200, but you want
the grid to start 100 pixels in from the left and top, the code would look something like:

    display = pygame.display.set_mode((200, 200), pygame.RESIZABLE)
    grid = Grid(display.get_width(), display.get_height(), 2, 2, 100, 100)

## ShapeFactory
### Import ShapeFactory
To import the shape factory use the following statement:

    from pygame_gridcalculator import ShapeFactory

### Initialize ShapeFactory
To initialize a Shape Factory, you need to pass in a valid GridCalculator to work with.
You can use the following logic to assign to a variable:

    grid = GridCalculator(display_width, display_height, grid_width, grid_height)
    shapefactory = ShapeFactory(grid)

The arguments to specify are as follows:
* __grid_calculator__: _The GridCalculator to use to generate shapes_

### ShapeFactory Methods and Functions
The shape factory has the following methods and functions:

The shape factory currently only creates shapes where positions are explicitly specified.
Any other shapes should be generated using the Rect method (as you generally pass in a Rect 
as part of the shape being drawn).  Further information on this can be found directly in the
[pygame draw documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html).

## Examples
### Basic usage
Setting the variable and creating a new rect using a grid calculator:

    display = pygame.display.set_mode((200, 100), pygame.RESIZABLE)
    display.fill((255, 255, 255))
    grid = GridCalculator(display.get_width(), display.get_height(), 10, 5)
    
    rect = pygame.Rect(grid.left_point(1), grid.top_point(1),
                       grid.width_gap(1, 3), grid.height_gap(1, 4))
    pygame.draw.rect(display, (255, 0, 0), rect)

So in this example, a pygame display is created of 200x100 pixels, and a grid
is created splitting this into a 10x5 grid, where each square is a 20x20 grid 
point, like so:

![Example 1 Grid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davethepunkyone/pygame-gridcalculator/main/images/example_1_grid.png)

When it comes to drawing the Rect, the calculator identifies that it requires the following:
 * Left grid point 1 as the start left position, which in this scenario returns 20
   * _Logic used: (200 / 10) * 1 = 20 pixels from left_
 * Top grid point 1 as the start top position, which in this scenario also returns 20 
   * _Logic used: (100 / 5) * 1 = 20 pixels from top_
 * The gap between left grid point 1 and 3 for the width, which returns 40 
   * _Logic used:_ 
     * _Point 1 = (200 / 10) * 1 = 20 pixels from left_
     * _Point 3 = (200 / 10) * 3 = 60 pixels from left_
     * _60 - 20 = 40 pixels width_
 * The gap between top grid point 1 and 4 for the height, which returns 60
   * _Logic used:_
     * _Point 1 = (100 / 5) * 1 = 20 pixels from top_
     * _Point 3 = (100 / 5) * 4 = 80 pixels from top_
     * _80 - 20 = 60 pixels height_

Using this information creates a rectangle on the screen like so:

### Full Scalable Example
The following creates an initial display with a rect and a grid that
can scale with the display.

    def example():
        running = True
        display = pygame.display.set_mode((300, 300), pygame.RESIZABLE)
        display_height, display_width = display.get_height(), display.get_width()
        grid = GridCalculator(display_width, display_height, 20, 20)
    
        pygame.init()
    
        while running:
            display.fill((200, 200, 200))
    
            for event in pygame.event.get():
                if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                    running = False
                    break
                if event.type == pygame.VIDEORESIZE:
                    display_height = event.h
                    display_width = event.w
                    grid = GridCalculator(display_width, display_height, 20, 20)
    
            # Draw face
            pygame.draw.rect(display, (255, 0, 0),
                             pygame.Rect(grid.left_point(5), grid.top_point(5),
                             grid.width_gap(5, 15), grid.height_gap(5, 15)))
            pygame.draw.rect(display, (0, 0, 255),
                             pygame.Rect(grid.left_point(7), grid.top_point(11),
                             grid.width_gap(7, 13), grid.height_gap(11, 14)))
            pygame.draw.rect(display, (0, 255, 0),
                             pygame.Rect(grid.left_point(7), grid.top_point(7),
                             grid.width_gap(7, 9), grid.height_gap(7, 9)))
            pygame.draw.rect(display, (0, 255, 0),
                             pygame.Rect(grid.left_point(7), grid.top_point(7),
                             grid.width_gap(7, 9), grid.height_gap(7, 9)))
            pygame.draw.rect(display, (0, 255, 0),
                             pygame.Rect(grid.left_point(11), grid.top_point(7),

                                         sq_width, sq_height))
            pygame.draw.rect(display, (0, 0, 0),

This splits the screen into a 20x20 grid, and is able to rescale dependent
on the size of the window.  If the size is changed, the rectangles will
scale based on the new size of the window, still in a 20x20 grid.

When the window initially loads, the shapes display like so:

If the window is resized, the shapes adjust with the size of the grid:

Dependent on the situation, you may want to modify the grid based on 
the window size and rescale the grid appropriately.  Because the grid is
repopulated on the resize an if statement could be added if needed to
check the screen width/height and modify the grid as needed.

### Snake Example

The full code for this example can be found in the 
[examples/snake_example.py](https://github.com/davethepunkyone/pygame-gridcalculator/tree/main/examples/snake_example.py)
file, which shows the use of the ShapeFactory to create the snake and fruit 
along with using the GridCalculator to house the positioning of the objects on
the screen.  This example also utilises a grid-in-grid to display a border around
the outside of the display.  This example is fully scalable, so the window can also be
resized as the game is in-play.
